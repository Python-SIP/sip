    be invoked using the '-m' command line option of the Python interpreter.

    state.  This is implemented using the %ReleaseCode directive, the SIP_USER
    flag and the sipConvertToTypeUS(), sipForceConvertToTypeUS() and
    sipReleaseTypeUS() API functions.  (ABI v13 only.)
  - %ConvertFromTypeCode and %ConvertToTypeCode are now optional for mapped
    types.
